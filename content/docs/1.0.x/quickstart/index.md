This Quick Start presents the [Keptn End-to-End Delivery](https://killercoda.com/keptn/scenario/keptn-end-to-end-delivery) exercise
which uses [Killercoda](https://killercoda.com/) to quickly introduce you to Keptn
without requiring you to have a Kubernetes cluster or install Keptn.
In less than an hour, you will learn about the main features of Keptn and how to implement them.

**Note:** The killercoda session expires after an hour or if it is idle for five minutes or longer
so you should plan to sit down and do the exercise without interruptions.

## Next steps

If you like what you saw in the exercise, you can:

* Install a Keptn cluster for yourself,
  following the instructions in [Installation](../../install).
  Scroll down past the "cards" on the landing page for a quick list of steps to take,
  with links to pages that have more details.

* Create your own project

  * [Manage Keptn Projects](../manage/) talks about about how to create and manage
    Keptn projects

  * [Keptn and other tools](../concepts/keptn-tools/) discusses how you can use Keptn
    with almost any other tools you want for your project.
